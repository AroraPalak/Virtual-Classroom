<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>1. The ratio of the number of boys and girls in a college is 7 : 8. If the percentage increase in the number of boys and girls be 20% and 10% respectively, what will be the new ratio?</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'> Explanation:

Originally, let the number of boys and girls in the college be 7x and 8x respectively.

Their increased number is (120% of 7x) and (110% of 8x).

		120 	x 7x 		and 		110 	x 8x 	
100 	100

	42x 	and 	44x
5 	5

The required ratio = 		42x 	: 	44x 		= 21 : 22.
5 	5

<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>2. An observer 1.6 m tall is 203 away from a tower. The angle of elevation from his eye to the top of the tower is 30�..</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'>  Explanation:

Let AB be the observer and CD be the tower.

Draw BE CD.

Then, CE = AB = 1.6 m,

      BE = AC = 203 m.

DE 	= tan 30� = 	1
BE 	3

DE = 	203 	m = 20 m.
3

CD = CE + DE = (1.6 + 20) m = 21.6 m.

<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>3. If 35 + 125 = 17.88, then what will be the value of 80 + 65 ?
</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font>Explanation:

35 + 125 = 17.88

35 + 25 x 5 = 17.88

35 + 55 = 17.88

85 = 17.88

5 = 2.235

80 + 65 = 16 x 5 + 65

   = 45 + 65

   = 105 = (10 x 2.235) = 22.35</br></br>
<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>4. Gauri went to the stationers and bought things worth Rs. 25, out of which 30 paise went on sales tax on taxable purchases. If the tax rate was 6%, then what was the cost of the tax free items?.
</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'>Explanation:

Let the amount taxable purchases be Rs. x.

Then, 6% of x = 	30
100

x = 		30 	x 	100 	= 5.

<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>5.A grocer has a sale of Rs. 6435, Rs. 6927, Rs. 6855, Rs. 7230 and Rs. 6562 for 5 consecutive months. How much sale must he have in the sixth month so that he gets an average sale of Rs. 6500?</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'> Explanation:

Total sale for 5 months = Rs. (6435 + 6927 + 6855 + 7230 + 6562) = Rs. 34009.

Required sale = Rs. [ (6500 x 6) - 34009 ]

   = Rs. (39000 - 34009)

   = Rs. 4991.</br></br>

<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'> Explanation:

Let the required number of revolutions made by larger wheel be x.

Then, More cogs, Less revolutions (Indirect Proportion)

14 : 6 :: 21 : x       14 x x = 6 x 21

x = 	6 x 21
14

x = 9.

<font color = 'blue' size = '4'><b>8. A number consists of two digits. If the digits interchange places and the new number is added to the original number, then the resulting number will be divisible by:</b></br>
<b>Ans.</b></font><font color = '#5f870e' size = '4'> Explanation:

Let the ten's digit be x and unit's digit be y.

Then, number = 10x + y.

Number obtained by interchanging the digits = 10y + x.

(10x + y) + (10y + x) = 11(x + y), which is divisible by 11.
